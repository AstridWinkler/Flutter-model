# Flutter application model

This model was created for a object modeling course. 
It made us learn all about the different existing diagramms which are made before a project.
They are here to help visualizing the layout of the application, the way the system is supposed to operate and how all the different parts interact with each other.
The following flutter model is one the step needed to ensure our total comprehension of the major expectations.

## The scenario of the project

The client association is an association of Bachelor and Master of Biology students from the University of Evry. This association is called "HelloBio", their goal being to popularize scientific articles in order to present them at the EvryBio scientific conference which takes place each year at the Institute of Genetic Biology and Bioinformatics of Evry (IBGBI).

The association wants to update its already existing website and set up a CMS blog. The latter will allow students to share articles of which they are the author, in order to discover concepts and high-level scientific advances, in a manner accessible to the general public. The subjects addressed in their articles will touch on different themes in the field of Biology: Cellular Biology, Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Genetics and Microbiology. These six major themes correspond to tags associated with articles and contain sub-categories such as, for example, gene regulation in cell biology, or databases in Bioinformatics. Each major theme will be associated with a color for maximum visibility and identification.

## Where this model comes from

The flutter model follows the scenario, even if it is purely aesthetic. The only goal is to display the ergonomy and the way things are interconnected.
We tried to give it a "real application" feeling, with warm colors and visually pleasant elements.

# Conclusion

We hope you enjoyed discovering this project, and maybe it was usefull to you personnaly ! 
We didn't have that much time to discover flutter and dart, but it was fun anyway, and we will come back to it someday. :)
Thank you !

## And thanks to...

Louise WEBER and Lucie GOMES who greatly contributed to how this application looks now : without my teammates, it would just have been that much more arduous !
Thanks girls ;)
